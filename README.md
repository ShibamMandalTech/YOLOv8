<h1>YOLO-Based Weed Detection in Precision Agriculture and Turfgrass Management</h1>

<div class="abstract">
  <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
  Weed detection plays a critical role in precision agriculture and sustainable turfgrass management. Traditional weed control methods primarily rely on herbicides, which have significant environmental and health concerns (Sportelli et al., 2023). The advancement of deep learning, particularly You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detectors, has enabled real-time weed detection in complex environments such as turfgrass and agricultural fields (Ajayi et al., 2023). This paper reviews the performance of various YOLO versions (YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) in detecting weeds across different settings, including UAV-based imagery and ground-based datasets. Comparative analysis highlights YOLOv8 as the most accurate model, but challenges such as background noise, lighting variations, and dataset limitations remain. Future research directions focus on dataset expansion, hybrid deep learning approaches, and deployment on edge devices for real-time weed management.

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Weed encroachment significantly affects agricultural productivity and the quality of turfgrass swards (Sportelli et al., 2023). Conventional weed management heavily relies on herbicides, which have been increasingly restricted due to environmental and health concerns (European Commission, 2023). As a result, researchers are exploring precision agriculture techniques that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for targeted weed control (Ajayi et al., 2023).</p>
  <p>Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning-based object detection methods in identifying and classifying weeds. YOLO object detectors, in particular, have gained popularity due to their high detection accuracy and real-time performance. This review examines different YOLO versions used in turfgrass and agricultural weed detection, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and future prospects.</p>

  <h2>2. YOLO-Based Weed Detection Models</h2>
  
  <h3>2.1 YOLO Architecture and Evolution</h3>
  <p>YOLO is a single-stage object detection algorithm designed for fast and efficient image analysis (Redmon et al., 2016). Unlike two-stage detectors such as Faster R-CNN, which separate region proposals from classification, YOLO directly predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities in one pass, making it ideal for real-time applications.</p>

  <h2>3. UAV-Based and Turfgrass Weed Detection</h2>

  <h3>3.1 UAV-Based Weed Detection</h3>
  <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in precision agriculture for high-resolution weed mapping. Model performance improves with increased training epochs, peaking before overfitting. However, image resolution, altitude, and lighting conditions greatly influence accuracy.</p>

  <h3>3.2 Weed Detection in Turfgrass</h3>
  <p>Turfgrass presents challenges due to its uniform background and dense vegetation. YOLO models have shown variable performance across species. YOLOv8 stands out for high detection rates in actively growing turfgrass.</p>
